This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, 

use npm or yarn to install node modules

Afrwe run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Note: I have followed figma rules of 4px (this means that every gap margin and padding should be a multiple of 4)

This that could be better: 
Theme to be sotore in cookies (for first render or server side cookie for saving theme type on server)
I was planing to use compound component structure for AppCard component but due to time limitation i was not able to achive that
The dev env is working 100% while for production npm run build will give error of invalid path mismatch for dynamic paths
